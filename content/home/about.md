# About Me

My name is Josiah Parry. I would consider myself a person of ecclectic interests, some of which are espresso, music, photography, social science, and data science. I fell into the **R-stats** world quite accidentally, but now I spend most days thinking about making things fit into the tidy paradigm. This site will share my interests in data science and my interactions with process.

I am a recent graduate with my B.A. in Sociology with a minor in Mathematics, and a certificate in Geographic Information Systems (**GIS**). Starting in the Fall of 2018 I will be starting the M.S. in Urban Informatics program at Northeastern University. 

Feel free to contact me if my skills can be of use to you, if you want to collaborate, or to just say hi. 

I spend a lot of time at cafes working on `geniusR`, school work, and editing photos. If you would like to sponsor a cup of coffee, press the button below!
